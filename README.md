# CPU-Simulator-Project
A fully functional CPU simulator capable of executing basic instructions (LOAD, STORE, ADD, SUB), in high-level C++ code with low-level assembly language functions. <br />

The CPU simulator is designed to emulate basic CPU operations, allowing for the execution of simple programs written in assembly language. <br />

**Emulation Scope:** <br />
* The simulator replicates essential CPU functionalities, enabling the execution of assembly language programs. <br />
* It provides a platform to study and simulate LOAD, STORE, ADD, and SUB operations, mimicking a real CPU's behavior. <br />

**Technological Foundation:** <br />
* Developed using C++ for high-level control and assembly language (NASM) for low-level operations. <br />
* Integration ensures seamless execution of assembly instructions within the simulated environment. <br />
